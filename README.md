# Decision-tree-optimization
This repository consists of the python notebooks which were created while trying to optimize the decision tree.

We know that the decision trees are prone to overfitting.  In this article I will be discussing how we can improve the prediction error for decision tree.
Overfitting of the decision trees to training data can be reduced by using pruning as well as tuning of hyperparameters.
Here am using the hyperparameter max_depth of the tree and by pruning [ finding the cost complexity].
This is an experimental study using two data sets to compare the two approaches for understanding. This article helps in getting started for anyone who is new to machine learning and wants to use decision tree classifier using scikit learn for their modelling.
